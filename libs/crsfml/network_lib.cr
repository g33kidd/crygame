  # Encapsulate an IPv4 network address

  # Create an address from a string
  #
  # Here `address` can be either a decimal address
  # (ex: "192.168.1.56") or a network name (ex: "localhost").
  #
  # *Arguments*:
  #
  # * `address`: IP address or network name
  #
  # *Returns*: Resulting address
  fun ip_address_from_string = sfIpAddress_fromString(address: LibC::Char*): IpAddress

  # Create an address from 4 bytes
  #
  # Calling IpAddress_fromBytes(a, b, c, d) is equivalent
  # to calling IpAddress_fromString("a.b.c.d"), but safer
  # as it doesn't have to parse a string to get the address
  # components.
  #
  # *Arguments*:
  #
  # * `byte0`: First byte of the address
  # * `byte1`: Second byte of the address
  # * `byte2`: Third byte of the address
  # * `byte3`: Fourth byte of the address
  #
  # *Returns*: Resulting address

  # Construct an address from a 32-bits integer
  #
  # This function uses the internal representation of
  # the address directly. It should be used for optimization
  # purposes, and only if you got that representation from
  # IpAddress_ToInteger.
  #
  # *Arguments*:
  #
  # * `address`: 4 bytes of the address packed into a 32-bits integer
  #
  # *Returns*: Resulting address
  fun ip_address_from_integer = sfIpAddress_fromInteger(address: UInt32): IpAddress

  # Get a string representation of an address
  #
  # The returned string is the decimal representation of the
  # IP address (like "192.168.1.56"), even if it was constructed
  # from a host name.
  #
  # *Arguments*:
  #
  # * `address`: Address object
  #
  # *Returns*: String representation of the address
  fun ip_address_to_string = sfIpAddress_toString(address: IpAddress, string: LibC::Char*)

  # Get an integer representation of the address
  #
  # The returned number is the internal representation of the
  # address, and should be used for optimization purposes only
  # (like sending the address through a socket).
  # The integer produced by this function can then be converted
  # back to a IpAddress with IpAddress_FromInteger.
  #
  # *Arguments*:
  #
  # * `address`: Address object
  #
  # *Returns*: 32-bits unsigned integer representation of the address
  fun ip_address_to_integer = sfIpAddress_toInteger(address: IpAddress): UInt32

  # Get the computer's local address
  #
  # The local address is the address of the computer from the
  # LAN point of view, i.e. something like 192.168.1.56. It is
  # meaningful only for communications over the local network.
  # Unlike IpAddress_getPublicAddress, this function is fast
  # and may be used safely anywhere.
  #
  # *Returns*: Local IP address of the computer
  fun ip_address_get_local_address = sfIpAddress_getLocalAddress(): IpAddress

  # Get the computer's public address
  #
  # The public address is the address of the computer from the
  # internet point of view, i.e. something like 89.54.1.169.
  # It is necessary for communications over the world wide web.
  # The only way to get a public address is to ask it to a
  # distant website; as a consequence, this function depends on
  # both your network connection and the server, and may be
  # very slow. You should use it as few as possible. Because
  # this function depends on the network connection and on a distant
  # server, you may use a time limit if you don't want your program
  # to be possibly stuck waiting in case there is a problem; use
  # 0 to deactivate this limit.
  #
  # *Arguments*:
  #
  # * `timeout`: Maximum time to wait
  #
  # *Returns*: Public IP address of the computer
