  fun thread_destroy = sfThread_destroy(thread: Thread)

  # *Arguments*:

  # * `thread`: Thread object

  #
  # This function will block the execution until the
  # thread's function ends.
  # Warning: if the thread function never ends, the calling
  # thread will block forever.
  # If this function is called from its owner thread, it
  # returns without doing anything.
  #
  # *Arguments*:
  #
  # * `thread`: Thread object

  # Terminate a thread
  #
  # This function immediately stops the thread, without waiting
  # for its function to finish.
  # Terminating a thread with this function is not safe,
  # and can lead to local variables not being destroyed
  # on some operating systems. You should rather try to make
  # the thread function terminate by itself.

  # *Arguments*:
  #
  # * `thread`: Thread object
